Hi

I have not produced a pdf file (I have asked Minyi and she was ok with it.), I have answered the questions in the notebook. 

The main reason why I produced the assignment in a note was to learn the plotly graphing library and how to create a motion chart myself. 

I have also produced a html version that can be read without running the notebook that also has all the interactions and animations.

THe only file that needs to be unzipped before running the notebook is the pollution_us_2000_2016.csv.tar.gz as it is 400mb uncompressed.


Thanks
